Tool name: logo.img Generator for MI PAD 4
Vendor: CK.Tex

This tool is used to customize logo.img image file for MI PAD 4.
Currently the tool has ONLY been tested on my own MI PAD 4 (MIUI 10.2 xiaomi.eu 8.11.1) and it works well.

Usage:
Place your image files under the "image" directory and then run the program. After that, flash the "logo.img" file generated under the "logo" directory using fastboot tool.

Note:
1. Pay attention to the names, extensions and formats of image files;
2. File sizes are strictly restrained. File 01.png should be no larger than 1535 bytes; File 02.bmp, 1050623 bytes; File 03.bmp, 187903 bytes; File 04.bmp, 2075135 bytes; File 05.bmp, 401407 bytes;
3. Strongly recommend that you backup the stock logo.img file of your device in case of failure for unknown reason during operation or incompatibility problems.
